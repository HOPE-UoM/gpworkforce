Files and code to get practice-level data on General Practice in England from the monthly releases of NHS England

The raw files can be downloaded from https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/general-and-personal-medical-services. All the monthly .csv files are collected for you in the file "csv.zip", available from "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1grivo6r0uwck5xaayoxf/csv.zip?rlkey=iirtdsviq9a2huvdztwwn3535&dl=0".

The Stata do-files to clean and prepare raw data will download directly "csv.zip" to a directory of your choice, and unzip all files in it to the same folder.
